So Ishita, I have a little surprise for you, didn't have any better way of showing you thats why
So Ishita open VS code
Create a folder with any name in it
Add 3 files in it under the name index.html, yes.html and style.css
This respository has the 3 files under the same name, copy the codes in the respective files blindly without reading anything (please). You can read once you have seen how the code works for you.
Eg: The code under the file named index.html in this repository should be copied in the index.html file you have created.
Remember do not make 3 seperate files. Make a single folder, lets say XXX, and in this make 3 files with the respective names I told.
Then ofc open the index.html file (do not scroll down) and run it, coz this is the main file through which the code has to be run, it'll lead you to a webpage I desgined just for trying out something different and ofc for you.
Have fun testing it out, reading it and playing with it.
I hope you enjoy it.
Please don't peek into the code before testing it out...
